## Project Overview

This frontend application provides an interactive user interface with authentication and routing capabilities. It utilizes a server (Node.js and Express) for handling requests and integrates various frontend libraries for enhanced UI and functionality.

## Technologies Used

The project is built with:

- **React** - Frontend library for building user interfaces.
- **React Router DOM** - For handling in-app navigation.
- **Express** - Backend framework to handle requests.
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework for responsive design.
- **Axios** - For HTTP requests.
- **JWT** - For secure user authentication.
- **MySQL and PostgreSQL** - Database options for user and data management.
- **dotenv** - For handling environment variables.

## Getting Started

To set up and run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd front
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment Variables**:

   Create a `.env` file in the project root and add any necessary environment variables (like database credentials, JWT secrets).

4. **Start the development server**:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`, and the server at `http://localhost:5000`.
